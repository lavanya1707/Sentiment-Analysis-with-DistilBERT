# Sentiment-Analysis-with-DistilBERTThe project used DistilBERT, a transformer-based model, for sentiment analysis on text reviews. Data preprocessing handled label conversion and missing values. The dataset was split into training and testing sets. DistilBERT tokenizer prepared the token sequences with padding. A custom PyTorch Dataset managed tokenized data. The model was fine-tuned for sentiment classification and evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics. Achieving high accuracy, the project demonstrated the power of transformer models in natural language processing tasks. Future improvements include hyperparameter tuning and exploring other transformer models to enhance sentiment prediction capabilities.
